            1. Phrase the questions to the group of learners clearly and specifically. Remember to not pose yes/no questions, as
            they do little to promote thinking or encourage discussion. Do not pose questions that are vague, ambiguous, or beyond
            the level of the learners.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. Wait Time: Maintain silence and wait at least 5 to 10 seconds for learners to respond. Call upon a learner.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            3. Keep the discussion focused. Follow up on learners' responses and invite elaboration from the answering learner or
            others from the group. Stimulate the discussion among learners with probing questions. Draw as many learners as
            possible into the discussion.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            *Use the Support Activity 1 to support and promote the discussion. You can configure the chat included to facilitate
            the communications between the students.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Learner: &nbsp;Participate when called upon. Answer questions as succinct and clearly as possible. The learner could
            use the chat and see the information in the support activities.<br>
