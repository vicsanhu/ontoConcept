Visibly write down ideas being contributed by the brainstorm participants. No matter how daft, how impossible or how silly an idea is, it must be written down.

Discourage the criticizing of ideas – there must be none of it. Laughing is to be encouraged, criticism is not.

End discussion when the time limit is reached.
