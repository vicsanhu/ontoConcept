<h4>Organiser View</h4>
        
<p>The Organiser View is an overview of all your Learning Designs (LDs) organised 
  into groups. If you cannot see the Organiser View, select <strong>Window-&gt;Show 
  View-&gt;Organiser</strong> from the menu.</p>
<p>Each entry in the tree is a bookmark or shortcut to an XML file in its own <strong>Root 
  Folder</strong>. You add new Learning Designs and Folders to the Organiser 
  View, or Import existing IMS LD packages and then edit them by double-clicking 
  the entry on the tree for the selected entry.</p>
<p>Different Organiser View entries can point to the same XML file if you wish, 
  this way you can reference the same file in more than one Folder, rather 
  like an &quot;alias&quot; or &quot;shortcut&quot; in a file manager.</p>
<p>Deleting a Learning Design entry from the Organiser View does not actually delete 
  the actual XML file that it points to. Therefore, you can always add it back 
  again by selecting the existing XML file from the &quot;Open Learning Design&quot; 
  dialog. </p>
<h5>Properties</h5>
<p>You can view the properties of an Organiser entry in the Organiser View 
  by selecting the <strong>File-&gt;Properties</strong> main menu item or by right-clicking 
  on a Learning Design entry in the tree and selecting the &quot;<strong>Properties</strong>&quot; 
  menu item. A window will appear with information about the entry.</p>
